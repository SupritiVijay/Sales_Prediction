<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a **Data Science** project using [C1 Company sales data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data).<br>
This project consists of *data analysis*, *model definition* and *model training and evaluation* using various data science packages. 


### Built With

* [NumPy](https://spark.apache.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Statmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Sci-Kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/)
* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The project consists of three stages:
1. [Data Exploration](#data-exploration)
2. [Extract Transform Load](#extract-transform-load)
3. [Model definition, training, and evaluation](#model-definition,-training,-and-evaluation)

The .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) files contain the three stages of the project.

## Data exploration

Data Exploration refers to the initial exploration of the dataset along with subtle data analysis to obtain a vague idea about the dataset.<br>
This consists of statistical description, correlation matrix, box plots, etc.

## Extract Transform Load
 
Extract Transform Load (ETL) refers to the process of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source or in a different context than the source.<br>
It also involves transforming the data, feature engineering, detailed data analysis and improving the overall quality of the data.

## Model definition, training, and evaluation
 
Model definition refers to the process of choosing the models those are best suited for the dataset, along with the initial hyperparameters.<br>
Model training refers to the process of fitting the models to the training data.<br>
Model evaluation refers to the process of evaluating the process of the models using certain appropriate evaluation metrics and tuning the hyperparameters again based on the results.<br>
<br>
It is an iterative process until required performance is obtained. 

## Usage

This project analyses time-series data and predicts future data using machine learning models trained over the same.<br>
This project approach can be used for the following:
* Weather forecasting
* Stock price prediction
* Sales analysis
* Business reformation

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/iemct/Sales_Prediction/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
